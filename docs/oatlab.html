                <b>Founding: </b> <br>
                I have been involved in OAT since its founding. As one oc the original members, I had a direct say on our first project, and pitched the affordable braille e-reader project that we ended up choosing. 
                <br><b>Electrical and Firmware:</b> <br>
                As a member of the electrical and firmware subteam for two semesters, I've had my hand in multiple projects, including designing the schematic for our prototype board, working with team members to develop firmware, and designing the schematic and PCB for the entire battery management and charging board
                <br><b>Future Work:</b> <br>
                As of 2026, I am to be the lead of the Electrical systems subteam. We hope to push our electrical designs from prototypes to final versions.
